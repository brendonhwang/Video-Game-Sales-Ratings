## 1. Project Overview and Objective
This project aims to convert raw data named "Video Game Sale and Rating" into a refined format suitable for data warehouses, providing meaningful insights for data analysts, and facilitating user-friendly features for data visualization. By employing techniques such as data cleansing, normalization, and manipulation, the objective is to uncover significant patterns, trends, and key metrics from the raw data. The incorporation of supplementary fields will empower users to create dashboards, enabling the communication of compelling narratives to a broader audience.

#### 1.1 Milestones
For this project, I opted to give precedence to the gathering of requirements and the design phase, with a specific focus on data cleaning and data mining. This strategic approach holds particular merit for a small project constrained by a tight schedule. The advantages of emphasizing these aspects include the attainment of clear requirements and the creation of an efficient design, both of which contribute to minimizing development efforts.
