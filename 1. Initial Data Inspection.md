# Initial Data Inspection

### Original Raw Data and Data Output
The raw data in the "video_game" dataset includes sales information categorized by game name and platform. 
The analysis reveals that the top global sales are led by Wii Sports, followed by Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart Wii, Wii Sports Resort, and Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue.

### Manipulated Data and Data Output
The raw data includes global sales categorized by both game name and platform. For those interested in viewing the top sales based solely on game names, I've developed a sample reference table that exclusively contains game names. This reference table simplifies the process of extracting data related to the top five global sales based on game names, separate from the sales associated with both game names and console platforms. Below, you'll find sample data, with Grand Theft Auto V noted as available on five platforms.

### Normalized Data that results in meaningful insight
Using this reference table, I was able to retrieve data for the top five global sales, including the game name, global sales, and the number of platforms the game is available on.  

As a result, Wii Sports retains its position as the number one global sale, followed by Grand Theft Auto V. The latter's high ranking is primarily attributed to its availability on five different platforms.

#### Lesson Learned: 
Examining the "video_game" dataset enabled me to enhance my comprehension of the data, a critical step in making well-informed decisions on how to clean and manipulate the dataset.
