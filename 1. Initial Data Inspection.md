# Initial Data Inspection

#### 1) Check for NULL values in specific columns -  [Name is null - 0 record]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE index IS NULL OR name IS NULL;

#### 2) Check for duplicate rows - [Same Name and index - 0 records; Same Name and Platform - 214 records]
SELECT index, name, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY index, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT name, platform, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY name, platform
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

#### 3) Check for data consistency (e.g., numeric columns) - [Sales based on Million dollars - 0 records]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE NOT na_sales::numeric >= 0

#### 4) Check for outliers or anomalies in numerical columns - [User score data field contains character - 2,441 records]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
-- WHERE global_sales > 100 or global_sales < 0
-- WHERE na_sales  > 100 or na_sales < 0
-- WHERE eu_sales > 100 or eu_sales  < 0
-- WHERE critic_score > 100 OR critic_score  < 0
-- WHERE critic_count > 1000 OR critic_count   < 0
WHERE user_score > 100 OR user_score  < 0
-- WHERE user_score = 'tbd'

#### 5) Check for unique values in a column - [No unique value for index - 0 record]
SELECT index, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY index
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT name, platform, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY name, platform
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

#### 6) Check for data within a specific date range  - [Range between 1980 to 2020 - 0 record]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE year_of_release >= '2021' OR year_of_release < '1980';
