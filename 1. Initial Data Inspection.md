# Initial Data Inspection

## Table Inspection
select 
table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, ordinal_position as no,column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length as max
FROM 
information_schema.columns 
WHERE 
table_name = 't_video_game_working'

select min(index), max(index), count(index)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin


## Data Inspection
#### 1) Check for NULL values in specific columns -  [Name is null - 0 record]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE index IS NULL OR name IS NULL;

#### 2) Check for duplicate rows - [Same Name and index - 0 records; Same Name and Platform - 214 records]
SELECT index, name, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY index, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT name, platform, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY name, platform
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

#### 3) Check for data consistency (e.g., numeric columns) - [Sales based on Million dollars - 0 records]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE NOT na_sales::numeric >= 0

#### 4) Check for outliers or anomalies in numerical columns - [User score data field contains character - 2,441 records]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
-- WHERE global_sales > 100 or global_sales < 0
-- WHERE na_sales  > 100 or na_sales < 0
-- WHERE eu_sales > 100 or eu_sales  < 0
-- WHERE critic_score > 100 OR critic_score  < 0
-- WHERE critic_count > 1000 OR critic_count   < 0
WHERE user_score > 100 OR user_score  < 0
-- WHERE user_score = 'tbd'

#### 5) Check for unique values in a column - [No unique value for index - 0 record]
SELECT index, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY index
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT name, platform, COUNT(*)
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
GROUP BY name, platform
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

#### 6) Check for data within a specific date range  - [Range between 1980 to 2020 - 0 record]
SELECT *
FROM video_game.t_video_game_origin
WHERE year_of_release >= '2021' OR year_of_release < '1980';


## Observation and Proposal Changes
1) Change year_of_release field from numeric to integer:
** Update the way the release year is stored to be a whole number (integer) instead of allowing decimal points.
2) Remove records for fields with duplicate game and platform:
**Check for and eliminate any rows where the combination of game title and platform are identical, ensuring each combination is unique.
3) Remove records with 'tbd' from user score and change the field type to numeric:
Find and delete any entries where the user score is marked as 'tbd' (to be determined). Then, adjust the way the user score is stored to be a numeric value.

These changes are intended to improve the data quality, making sure the data is stored in a more appropriate format and removing duplicates and placeholders like 'tbd' from the user scores. I plan to inspect the data in more detail and make additional changes.
